    ### Disclaimer

    This tool is designed to support researchers, students, and professionals in exploring and engaging with technical research papers. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to summarize and interact with paper content.

    Please note:

    - The responses generated are based on machine learning predictions and may not always reflect the original paper accurately.
    - This application should be used as a starting point for exploration, not a substitute for reading the source material.
    - We strongly encourage users to verify outputs against the original publications and, when necessary, consult domain experts.

    The development team has taken care to minimize errors and biases, but:
    - The underlying AI model may produce incomplete, imprecise, or misleading statements.
    - Generated content should not be cited or used as an authoritative source.

    This interface is intended to enhance comprehension, not replace critical thinking or scholarly review.
